## Hi, I'm Justzienz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer with experience in Java, C++, Node.js, Python and various web technologies. I am passionate about building web applications, server-side applications, and automation scripts. My experience includes working on Node.js projects, Python projects, and Instagram automation bots.

On my GitHub page, you'll find some of my personal projects, including Node.js projects, Python projects, and automation scripts. I'm always learning and experimenting with new technologies, so you might find some other interesting things as well.

In addition to my software development work, I have also created several Instagram automation bots such as:

[@thereelsbot](https://www.instagram.com/thereelsbot/)
Which finds and shares funny and entertaining reels every 2-4 hours.

[@factsofai](https://www.instagram.com/factsofai/)
Which uses AI to generate random facts and turn them into videos with voiceover.

[@themoviebot](https://www.instagram.com/themoviebot/)
Which selects a random movie from the web and downloads a random clip from it.

Feel free to browse my repositories and contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
